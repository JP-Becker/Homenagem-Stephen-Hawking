            <p class="sobre__texto"><span class="sobre__texto-cor">Stephen William Hawking</span> was director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge. He was also the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge between 1979 and 2009. Hawking was born in <span class="sobre__texto-cor"> Oxford</span>, into a family of physicians.</p>

            <p class="citacao__texto">“Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don't just give up.”</p>

            <div class="realizacoes__div-radiacao">
                <p class="realizacoes__texto-radiacao">Stephen’s greatest scientific achievement was a discovery about black holes in 1974 that shook the world of physics. According to Einstein’s theory, nothing — including light — can escape from inside a black hole. That’s why it’s black. But Stephen found that black holes are not really completely black. Instead, due to the subtle consequences of quantum physics, they emit what we now call Hawking radiation.</p>

                <p class="realizacoes__texto-singularidade">Along with Roger Penrose, Hawking’s work informs the way we think about black holes – and even the nature of the Big Bang. While the origin of our universe is still fervently debated, and the quantum details get rather hairy, the popular understanding of all of the matter of our universe being squeezed into a single point is partially thanks to Hawking’s extensive work.</p>

            <div class="realizacoes__div-deficiencia">
                <p class="realizacoes__texto-deficiencia">Hawking’s successes serve as an inspiration to us all, and as a stark reminder of what one can achieve even in the face of severe adversity. Not only do people with disabilities deserve respect and compassion, but we should take care to never box anyone in with pre-conceived notions of what any individual is capable of accomplishing.</p>
